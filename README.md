## General Information about the app

This app allows you to see reviews on games that Users have uploaded.  It lists all of the reviews and allows you to sort and filter the results.  You can select a certain review and it will give you more information on a new page.  Once on a particular review you can vote for that review if you think that it is deserving.  Underneath a review are the comments associated with that it, and also a feature that allows you to add your own comment.  There is also a feature that allows you to see all users and login as one so that you can add comments.
